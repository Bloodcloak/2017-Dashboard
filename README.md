# 2017-Dashboard
Our drivestation labview dashboard for the 2017 season.

# The files will not be uploaded at this time due to other commitments outside of the team. The estimated upload date is Mid to Late September.

This is to be used with 2017-RobotCodeV4 but can be edited to work with the other 2017 code we have published. Some features within this dashboard are: 
  
  ) Cluster file saving and sending of varables to the robot
  
  ) Automated pull from hardcoded file path for the configuration clusters upon app boot
  
  ) Dashboard side logic which is able to change the color of the time remaining indicator in corralation to coded times for a quick reminder during a match
  
  ) automated push of the selected auton when a reconnect event happens.
