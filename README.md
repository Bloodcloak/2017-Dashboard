# 2017-Dashboard
Our drivestation labview dashboard for the 2017 season.

This is to be used with 2017-RobotCodeV4 but can be edited to work with the other 2017 code we have published. Some features within this dashboard are: 
  
  ) Cluster file saving and sending of varables to the robot
  
  ) Automated pull from hardcoded file path for the configuration clusters upon app boot
  
  ) Dashboard side logic which is able to change the color of the time remaining indicator in corralation to coded times for a quick reminder during a match
  
  ) automated push of the selected auton when a reconnect event happens.
